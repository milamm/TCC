  In this article, we discuss an efficient mobile phone implementation of a state-of-the-art algorithm
  for computing robust image features called SURF.
  We implement several improvements to the basic algorithm that significantly improve its performance and
  reduce its memory footprint making the use of this algorithm on the mobile phone practical.
  Our prototype implementation has been applied to several practical applications such as image search,
  object recognition and augmented reality applications.},
