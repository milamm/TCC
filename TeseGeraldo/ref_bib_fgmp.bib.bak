  abstract = {This study is based on the numerical analysis of the properties of
	routinelyobserved hydrometeorological data which in South Africa
	alone is collectedat a rate of more than half a million station days
	per year, with somerecords approaching 100 continuous years in length.
	The analysis of thisdata demonstrates an unequivocal synchronous
	linkage between these processesin South Africa and elsewhere, and
	solar activity. This confirms observationsand reports by others in
	many countries during the past 150 years. It isalso shown with a
	high degree of assurance that there is a synchronouslinkage between
	the statistically significant, 21-year periodicity in theseprocesses
	and the acceleration and deceleration of the sun as it movesthrough
	galactic space. Despite a diligent search, no evidence could befound
	of trends in the data that could be attributed to human activities.It
	is essential that this information be accommodated in water resourcedevelopment
	and operation procedures in the years ahead.}

  abstract = {A new instrument for measuring cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) on

	becausethey are less costly, but they require instruments that are

	at a frequencyappropriate for aircraft speeds. The instrument design
	combines the streamwisegradient technique previously reported by
	J. G. Hudson, and the alternatinggradient condensation nuclei counter
	described by W. A. Hoppel et al. Fieldand laboratory measurements,
	and modeling studies show that this combinationexhibits poor sensitivity
	for the measurement of CCN spectra; for the climaticallyimportant
	range of critical supersaturations, 0.03%–1%, the measured variable,droplet
	diameter, varies only by 30%. The ability to resolve CCN spectrausing
	this method is therefore in question. Studies of this instrumentin
	a fixed supersaturation mode show that it can measure CCN at a singlesupersaturation
	in the range of 0.1%–2%. Calibration and testing of theinstrument
	in this mode is described. The instrument is capable of makingaccurate,
	high-frequency (.0.1 Hz) measurements of CCN at a fixed supersaturation,while
	satisfying the constraints for small aircraft.}

  volume = {8},
  pages = {1661-1675},
  abstract = {In-situ measurements in convective clouds (up to the freezing level)
	over the Amazon basin show that smoke from deforestation fires prevents
	clouds from precipitating until they acquire a vertical development
	of at least 4 km, compared to only 1–2 km in clean clouds. The average
	cloud depth required for the onset of warm rain increased by _350m
	for each additional 100 cloud condensation nuclei per cm3 at a super-saturation
	of 0.5% (CCN0.5%). In polluted clouds, the diameter of modal liquid
	water content grows much slower with cloud depth (at least by a factor
	of _2), due to the large number of droplets that compete for available
	water and to the suppressed coalescence processes. Contrary to what
	other studies have suggested, we did not observe this effect to reach
	saturation at 3000 or more accumulation mode particles per cm3. The
	CCN0.5% concentration was found to be a very good predictor for the
	cloud depth required for the on et of warm precipitation and other
	microphysical factors, leaving only a secondary role for the updraft
	velocities in determining the cloud drop size distributions. The
	effective radius of the cloud droplets (re) was found to be a quite
	robust parameter for a given environment and cloud depth, showing
	only a small effect of partial droplet evaporation from the cloud’s
	mixing with its drier environment. This supports one of the basic
	assumptions of satellite analysis of cloud microphysical processes:
	the ability to look at different cloud top heights in the same region
	and regard their re as if they had been measured inside one well
	developed cloud. The dependence of re on the adiabatic fraction decreased
	higher in the clouds, especially for cleaner conditions, and disappeared
	at re__10?m. We propose that droplet coalescence, which is at its
	peak when warm rain is formed in the cloud at re=_10(micro)m, continues
	to be significant during the cloud’s mixing with the entrained air,
	cancelling out the decrease in re due to evaporation.},

  journal = {Journal of Meteorology},
  year = {1949},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {134–149},
  abstract = {Recent studies of precipitation, aircraft icing, and visibility through
	fog have focussed attention on the physical constitution of clouds,
	a subject to which knowledge of the drop-size spectrum and its origin
	would be an important contribution. The drop-size spectrum resulting
	when air containing condensation nuclei is uniformly cooled may be
	computed, leading to a differential equation for the growth of a
	cloud drop which cannot be integrated analytically. A numerical method
	of integration is therefore employed.
	
	
	Three integrations of drop growth under simulated natural conditions
	are described and compared with data for natural clouds, leading
	to the following conclusions:
	
	
	The computed drop-size spectra agree with observation regarding the
	relatively uniform clouds most frequently observed. Convergence and
	mixing of fine-grained turbulence are suggested as influences broadening
	the distribution in the less uniform clouds. Even for the latter,
	the computed spectra agree with observation on the shape of the spectrum
	curve. It is not clear what conditions of cooling most favor a broad
	spectrum. The computed mean drop sizes agree very well with observation,
	indicating that growth by collision is not ordinarily significant
	in uniform clouds.
	
	
	The concentration of drops is determined primarily by the rate of
	cooling during the initial stage of condensation. It depends, as
	a rule, only slightly on the concentration of condensation nuclei.
	With continued uniform cooling, the drop concentration diminishes
	slightly toward a fixed constant value. It can be increased, once
	the cloud has formed, only through a great increase in the rate of
	cooling.
	
	
	Supersaturation during cloud formation ordinarily reaches about 0.1
	per cent and can surpass 1 per cent only under extreme circumstances.
	Subsaturations in descending air currents have the same order of
	magnitude. Observations of lower relative humidities in clouds, if
	real, must indicate clear spaces.
	
	
	Operation of the equation of growth on nuclei of modal sizes proposed
	by Dessens cannot explain the modal drop sizes reported by Köhler.},

	The calibrations coverthe supersaturation range 0.3% to 1%. For each
	supersaturation, the CCNconcentration was found to be proportional
	to the detector output. Duringthe activation and growth of droplets,
	the time of peak signal correspondswell to the time at which droplet
	count is a maximum within the samplevolume. The use of an average
	output signal over a period bracketing themean position of the peak
	is a slightly better measure of droplet concentrationsthan the peak
	value. The calibration equations here derived are specificto the
	CCN counter used to obtain the data. Also, the calibration constantscan
	be expected to be dependent on the type of aerosol which serve as
	CCN;the limited data so for available show only weak variations in

  abstract = {The extent to which growth is limited by climatic factors or soil
	fertility is of significance to foresters concerned with the management
	of Sitka spruce plantations throughout Great Britain. A simplified
	physiologically based model, driven with monthly weather data, provided
	a means to assess growth limitations imposed by solar radiation,
	subfreezing and suboptimal temperatures, soil drought and atmospheric
	vapour pressure deficits, wind and soil fertility at sites differing
	in maximum wood volume production by fourfold. To drive the model,
	conventional weather station data were extrapolated to provide estimates
	of precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure deficits, suboptimal
	temperatures and frequency of subfreezing conditions. Variation in
	solar radiation associated with topography accounted for nearly half
	the differences observed in plantation growth. Unfavourable temperatures
	reduced annual photosynthesis and growth only by 10–15 per cent as
	they occur primarily in months with limited solar radiation. Drought
	and vapour pressure deficits do not appear to offer major constraints
	on growth. Soil fertility, however, significantly limited growth
	on a number of sites. The modelling approach provides a measure of
	nutrient availability by predicting the maximum accumulation of nitrogen
	in the canopy. The modelling analysis suggests that foresters could
	improve forecasts of Sitka spruce plantation growth throughout the
	UK with better estimates of solar radiation and canopy nitrogen content
	than with more conventional sets of measurements.},

  journal = {Atmospheric Measurement. Technology},

  abstract = {Most aerosol measurements require an inlet system
	
	to transport aerosols from a select sampling location to a
	
	suitable measurement device through some length of tubing.
	
	Such inlet systems must be optimized to minimize aerosol
	
	sampling artifacts and maximize sampling efficiency. In this
	
	study we introduce a new multifunctional software tool (Particle
	
	Loss Calculator, PLC) that can be used to quickly determine
	
	aerosol sampling efficiency and particle transport
	
	losses due to passage through arbitrary tubing systems. The
	
	software employs relevant empirical and theoretical relationships
	
	found in established literature and accounts for the
	
	most important sampling and transport effects that might
	
	be encountered during deployment of typical, ground-based
	
	ambient aerosol measurements through a constant-diameter
	
	sampling probe. The software treats non-isoaxial and nonisokinetic
	
	aerosol sampling, aerosol diffusion and sedimentation
	
	as well as turbulent inertial deposition and inertial deposition
	
	in bends and contractions of tubing. This software
	
	was validated through comparison with experimentally determined
	
	particle losses for several tubing systems bent to
	
	create various diffusion, sedimentation and inertial deposition
	
	properties. As long as the tube geometries are not “too
	
	extreme”, agreement is satisfactory. We discuss the conclusions
	
	of these experiments, the limitations of the software
	
	and present three examples of the use of the Particle Loss
	
	Calculator in the field.},
