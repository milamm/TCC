\PARstartOne{C}{onsidering} the rapid climate change indicatives on a global scale, deeper knowledge in development
of these studies, instruments to measure various physical parameters of the atmosphere are being developed
and constantly improved. This article describes a system for automatic measurement of the concentration of
atmospheric aerosols by computer vision, the procedures and infrastructure of the laboratory for evaluation,
and finally presents the results of an intercomparison. The measurement system developed uses digital
image processing techniques. The process consists of capturing a sample of atmospheric air inside a static
thermal diffusion chamber supersaturated with water vapor. In this condition, the molecules of water vapor
condenses on the aerosol captured in the air, producing water droplets. These droplets fall by gravity and
cross a laser light beam, that defines a sampling volume, which makes them visible. A series of images of
this process is digitized and processed for identification and isolation of the droplets present in the sample
volume. These drops are then automatically counted and their concentration is calculated using binarization,
watershed transform and count by connected regions techniques. A new method for determination of sample
volume is also presented. The results of the intercomparison experiments under controlled conditions, using
as aerosol ammonium sulfate, indicate that the procedures are appropriate in determining the concentration of atmospheric aerosols.
